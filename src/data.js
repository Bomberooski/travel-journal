        description: "Warlock's Crypt or Warlock's Keep lay in the Troll Hills on the Sword Coast in west Faerûn. It was home to the ancient lich wizard Larloch the Shadow King, a survivor of the fallen empire of Netheril. The name itself was a corruption of \"Larloch's Crypt\" or \"Larloch's Keep\". It was a great city of undead, rife with wickedness and necromancy. The city was made out of the ruins of a millennia-old Netherese flying enclave called Orbedal or Sanctuary, which had been dedicated to being a haven for peace before it crashed to the ground in the downfall of Netheril.",
